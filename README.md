## Follow Along Steps

Download the project [here](https://github.com/interlock/digitized-ios/zipball/master)

Unzip this file in your work/project folder.

Open up the file, "Digitized.xcworkspace"

### Storyboards

Open up the file "Digitized/MainStoryBoard.storyboard".

Our app is going to have 3 tabs:
* A digitized tweet feed
* A view of the digitized tumbler feed
* A map that zooms in
* A touch tab

Lets hook up our first tab: Digitized Tweets

### Under the hood

Each of the "View Controllers" has a corresponding ObjC code implementation. It customizes what the will be shown and handles the particulars of how to handle input from the user.

### Hooking up the digitized feed

Lets hook up the digitized feed now and customize the twitter hash tag in the code.

### Hooking up the tumblr web view

### Hooking up the map
